               <p>Based off of Jafar from Aladdin. A generous man who was born into vast wealth. Always wears a smile on his face. A bit ditsy and clumsy so look after him! </p>

               <p>Based off of Hades from Hercules. A very introverted boy who tends to shy away from socialization. At times, he can get very talkative and animated. Give him a chance and we promise it's worth it! </p>

               <h4>Malleus Draconia</h4>
